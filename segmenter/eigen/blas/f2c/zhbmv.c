/*  Purpose */
/*  ======= */

/*  ZHBMV  performs the matrix-vector  operation */

/*     y := alpha*A*x + beta*y, */

/*  where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are n element vectors and */
/*  A is an n by n hermitian band matrix, with k super-diagonals. */

/*  Arguments */
/*  ========== */

/*  UPLO   - CHARACTER*1. */
/*           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower */
/*           triangular part of the band matrix A is being supplied as */
/*           follows: */

/*              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   The upper triangular part of A is */
/*                                  being supplied. */

/*              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   The lower triangular part of A is */
/*                                  being supplied. */

/*           Unchanged on exit. */

/*  N      - INTEGER. */
/*           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. */
/*           N must be at least zero. */
/*           Unchanged on exit. */

/*  K      - INTEGER. */
/*           On entry, K specifies the number of super-diagonals of the */

/*           The following program segment will transfer the upper */
